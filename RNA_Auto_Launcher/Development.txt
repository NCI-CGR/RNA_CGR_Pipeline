09/11/2020 (need to discuss with Mia next week)

1: Interface:

how to call "Submit.sh"

/DCEG/Projects/Exome/SequencingData/DAATeam/RNAPipeline/Mia/Submit.sh /DCEG/CGF/Sequencing/Illumina/MiSeq/PostRun_Analysis/Data/200820_M01354_0001_000000000-J2527

2: I would write a new tag in "LIMS_RNA_Pipeline" to define if the email has been sent 

   flag_email_sent_done
   
3: Email Notification list

   who should be included 
   
4; For archived RNA data 

   (1) Read only, we cannot create the folder "LIMS_RNA_Pipeline" in the same folder of the flowcell directely. 

5: For testing purpose: 

/DCEG/CGF/Sequencing/Illumina/MiSeq/PostRun_Analysis/Data/200820_M01354_0001_000000000-J2527
